# Minecraft 1.2.5 fixed mods
A collection of fixed mods for Minecraft 1.2.5

Playing Minecraft 1.2.5 in 2021 is a bit cumbersome, specially if you want to use mods. Most famously, Modloader and other mods fail to work if your Minecraft installation isn't the old standard (`%APPDATA%/.minecraft/bin/minecraft.jar` in Windows, for instance) throwing the dreaded `URI is not hierarchical` exception on startup.

In fact, I began this project adapting the [fix for Modloader b1.7.3 by coffeenotfound](https://github.com/coffeenotfound/ModloaderFix-b1.7.3) to Modloader 1.2.5.

Most subfolders include decompiled source code and a ready to use `.zip` file with the full mod.

Best regards. I like [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/nathmojon).
