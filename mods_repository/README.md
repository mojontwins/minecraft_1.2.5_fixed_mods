# Mods repository

Those mods work as-is.

* *Rei's Minimap* `[1.2.5]ReiMinimap_v3.2_05.zip`- Patch with the fixed *Modloader* from this repo then copy the zip to your `.minecraft/mods` folder.
* *Soundmod* `AudioMod 1.2.5.zip` - put the files in the zip inside your `Minecraft.jar` and delete `META_INF`.
